-Docker desktop installer prompts to install wsl
-WSL requires signout/signin
-Docker desktop then starts with button to restart the app after WSL installed
-> need to store state for app
&& need to add a RunOnce registry note so we can continue the urbit setup after
	Docker & WSL are completed
-> also should check before doing all this work if Docker is already installed
	(`where docker`); if it is we can skip this entire setup thing
